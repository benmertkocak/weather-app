# weather-app
An application where you can access location information or the weather of the desired location

This Python code creates an interface that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data using the tkinter and PIL libraries. The user can get weather information by entering a city name in the input box in the interface. Also, clicking the "Find Using Location" button automatically retrieves weather information based on the user's location. The interface displays the name and country of the city, temperature, weather conditions, and a weather icon. The code also downloads this token via the URL retrieved from the API and displays it in the interface.
Before using the app, create yourself an api_key from "https://openweathermap.org/" to be able to enter YOUR_API_KEY.
                api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
